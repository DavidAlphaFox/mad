i am not responsible for problems you may get while installing this, and know that this isn't complete

use **[ufetch](https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch)** *( or the one in usr/local/bin )*

**[zsh:](https://zsh.org)** plugins are [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh) and [syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

I recently switched to [fish](https://fishshell.com)

Also, remember that this is a work in progress, if anything important is missing, tell me!

I do not plan on making an installation script, and **make sure you know what you're doing.**

These dotfiles contain 2 shells + 4 window managers \( [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) || [fish](https://fishshell.com) + [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) || [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) || [qtile](https://www.qtile.org) || [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) \) 

qtile has swallowing now, also, qtile is configured for xorg, i no longer plan on adding proper wayland config as i do not need it
