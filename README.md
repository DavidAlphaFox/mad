i am not responsible for problems you may get while installing this && know that this isn't complete

**bspwm:** use [this](https://github.com/MaybeAnonymous/bspswallow) for bspwm window swallowing, it's a fork i made of another project

**ufetch:** default is artix, get your own [here](https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch) 

**zsh:** it may give you error message, install the plugins [here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh) and [here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

**fish:** my config file is quite simple as i just switched to it, zsh will still be here though.

!C means closed source/proprietary!!

;; means it is pre-installed and you should not worry

|| means or

+ means and
```

also remember that this is a work in progress, if anything important is missing, tell me

these dotfiles contain two shells and two window managers \( [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) && [fish](https://fishshell.com), [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org) && [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) \) 

i do not plan on making an installation script, and i expect you to know what you're doing
